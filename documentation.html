<h1>Documentation</h1>

<p>The <span class = "jail">JAIL</span> <span class = "od2">|OD|</span> <span class="jail">BREAK</span> project has been carried out for the exam Open Access and Digital Ethics of Digital Humanities and Digital Knowledge course at the University of Bologna. The aim of the project is the analysis and the further re-use of open access datasets, in order to find some kind of new knowledge reachable through the mashup of the original data.</p>

<p>You can directly consult our GitHub repository here.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>On this page you can read the detailed analysis of the CROWD project, which aims to investigate the European and Italian prison conditions to understand in what terms the human rights of prisoners are respected.</p>
<h2>Scenario</h2>
<p>Prison conditions have always been a sensitive issue to reflect on. We believe that is necessary that the guilt of the person, which deprives her/him of her/his freedom, does not also imply a loss of her/his fundamental human rights. We therefore searched for information, analyzed varied datasets, sometimes difficult to find or not useful anymore because not updated, with the aim of creating a concise and clear mashup of elements capable of providing interested users a complete and rich perspective of European and Italian prison conditions. </p>
<h2>General Analysis</h2>
<p>Table to add</p>
<h2>Quality analysis of the datasets</h2>
<p>As far as quality analysis is concerned, the standards we have taken into consideration come mainly from a source, which is the Open Data Goldbook for Data Managers and Data Holders, provided by the European Data Portal. We relied on this resource because our datasets refer to European data and consequently it seemed particularly fitting to take advantage of this relevant document.</p>
<p>The standards for quality we decided to take in consideration are:</p>
<ul>
  <li><span class= "bold">Completeness:</span>  are the datasets complete? Is there information concerning what is the data about, where does it come from and for what purpose has it been published? Are there sufficient indicators?</li><br>
  <li><span class= "bold">Accuracy:</span> are the datasets accurate enough for their purpose? How much are they error-free so as to be a reliable source? </li><br>
  <li><span class= "bold">Timeliness:</span> data changes over time. Are the data up to date?  This topic is closely related to the maintenance of datasets. </li><br>
  <li><span class= "bold">Reusability:</span> are the datasets made available under an open license so that they can be reused? </li>
</ul>

<h3>UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime)</h3>
<p>The data is clear and quite complete although some datasets are quite sparse. The source of each dataset is specified. The data are open, accessible and, about reusability, they can be viewed and downloaded in different formats. The data are clean and there are no visible errors. However, the description of these same data is sometimes lacking. Status and version number of the datasets are not explicitly reported.</p>

<h3>OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)</h3>
<p>This dataset presents a brief description of the main topics. The purposes and methods of data collection are explicitly stated. Further and more detailed information regarding coverage and accuracy as well as reliability can be found in the World Health Statistics Annuals. As regards the possibility of reusing the data, the manipulation of the same is simplified by the specifications provided by the source institution. In different datasets we can find the same indicators. Each type of modification and update is promptly reported.</p>

<h3>Eurostat</h3>
<p>As for the datasets from Eurostat, they are well described thanks also to the explanatory texts (metadata). As for completeness, it depends on the availability of national data from statistical institutes. Instead, with regard to consistency, it is reported in the metadata that "the data are checked for completeness, internal consistency, and consistency over time and coherence with other relevant data sources". On the other hand, there is a lack of explicit information regarding accuracy. The data are explorable, editable and filterable. However, they can be downloaded in a few formats. The indicators are sufficient but sometimes unclear. The updating is explicitly reported.</p>

<h3>World Health Organization (WHO):</h3>
<p>The WHO Regional Office for Europe developed the HIPED (Health in Prisons European Database) because of the lack of systematically collected and comparable data on the health of incarcerated people. The database provides an overview of health in prisons according to important public health indicators and includes data collected through the National questionnaire for the minimum public health dataset for prisons in the WHO European Region in 2016/2017. The main purposes are explicit: to provide comprehensive, consistent and reliable public health data on prison populations and their health needs across WHO European Region Member States. The database is divided into several domains and this allows users to easily explore it. Some data are not up to date, but this mainly depends on the national statistical institutes. Unfortunately, those out-of-date data (i.e., prison population analysis dates to 2016) compromises the timeliness. The updates are clarified but these also date back to 2019, so they are out of date. The data can be filtered and downloaded in various formats. There is additional information to individual domains, but it is not systematic.</p>

<h3>Ministero della Giustizia:</h3>
<p>As regards the data present in the Ministero della Giustizia, datasets provided come from reliable sources they are particularly up to date, divided by topic and region (being data linked to Italy). They are reliable, enriched with metadata. However, the data are absolutely non-reusable. It is not possible to download them and they are simple tables inserted within the site. This greatly nullifies its usefulness.</p>

<h3>Our World in Data</h3>
<p>The interesting thing about Our World in Data is that the data comes from trusted funds and there are several ways to view and access it. They are accurate and available under CC-By license which implies that they can be reused, downloaded in different formats and cited. The indicators are sufficient to make the dataset complete and the subdivision into domains and sub-domains facilitates navigation. </p>

<h2>Legal Analysis</h2>
<p>First, we wanted to establish all the different licenses that our sources use as they often differ. We have then structured a complete legal checklist that you can consult here.  We took into account the standards defined by the Open Data Goldbook for Data Managers and Data Holders and we took into account the four main directives of the Open Data release:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Privacy: GDPR Regulation (EU) 2016/679, Regulation (EU) 2018/1807, Directive 2002/58/EC;</li> <br>
  <li>PSI: Directive (EU) 2019/1024;</li> <br>
  <li>CDSM: DIRECTIVE (EU) 2019/790;</li> <br>
  <li>INSPIRE: Directive 2007/2/EC that define particular limitation on public access for the spatial and geo data.</li>
</ul>

<p>Given those standards and directives the main topics that were considered for the legal analysis of the datasets are: IPR policies, privacy issues, limitations on public access, licences, economic conditions and temporal aspects of the dataset. </p>
<p>Generally speaking, the licenses used by our sources are: </p>

  <h3>UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime)</h3>
  <p>There is not explicit information about the license used, but it is explicitly said that “all data and metadata provided on dataUNODC website are available free of charge and may be copied freely, duplicated, and further distributed provided that UNODC is cited as the reference. There is the chance of accessing a Terms of Use and Policy Notice page, even if there is no particularly detailed information. </p>
  
  <h3>OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)</h3>
  <p>The Terms and Conditions page provides information and encourages the reuse of data, publications and multimedia products of OECD and satellite or related website(s). Even in this case, the license is not explicitly mentioned but data are stated as free to be copied, adapted, downloaded and distributed as long as OECD is cited as the reference.</p>
  
  <h3>Eurostat</h3>
  <p>It is under the Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 International (CC BY 4.0) license. Reuse is authorised as long as the source is acknowledged. The reuse policy of European Commission documents is regulated by Decision 2011/833/EU (OJ L 330, 14.12.2011, p. 39). In the Privacy policy section there is information about Personal Data Protection policy, which is based on Regulation (EU) No 1725/2018 of the European Parliament and of the Council of 23 October 2018 on the protection of natural persons with regard to the processing of personal data by the Union institutions, bodies, offices and agencies and on the free movement of such data (repealing Regulation (EC) No 45/2001 of 18 December 2000 and Decision No 1247/2002/EC).</p>
  
  <h3>World Health Organization (WHO):</h3>
  <p>The World Health Organization (“WHO”) encourages the public to access and use the data that it collects and publishes on its web site if appropriate credits are given to WHO. The license used is not explicitly defined but WHO grants the royalty-free, worldwide, non-exclusive right to use, reproduce, extract, download, copy, distribute, display or include the Datasets and data contained therein in other products for public health purposes. The Privacy Policy page fully describe the way in which it collects and use personal data.</p>

The re-use, reproduction, extraction, copy of data available on this site are authorized only to the extent that they take place in compliance with the public interest in information, for non-commercial purposes, ensuring the integrity of the elements reproduced and indicating the source. The administration identifies the hypotheses of possible use also for commercial purposes.</p>
  
  <h3>Our World in Data</h3>
  <p>The license used is CC BY 4.0 (made explicit in the footer). The Privacy Policy page gives precise and punctual information about the collection of data and the way in which Our World in Data collects and use the personal data, in accordance with the GDPR and related UK data protection legislation.</p>

<h2>Ethical Analysis</h2>

<p>Concerning ethical analysis, we considered different aspects: the centrality of the human being, equality and transparency, reliability and affidability, sustainability and finally the rationality in judgment which means the freedom from cognitive bias.  The principles we relied on were the ones proposed by the document “Data Ethics: Principles and Guidelines for Companies, Authorities & Organisations”. </p>

<h3>UNODC (United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime)</h3>
<p>Even though the specifications regarding the ethical processing of data are not exhaustive on the portal, UNODC is committed to support Member States in the implementation of the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, which “draws together various elements into a comprehensive and forward- looking framework and explicitly recognizes the importance of sustainable development. The 2030 Agenda includes the rule of law and fair, effective and human justice systems, as well as health-oriented responses to drug use confirming that their absence impedes development in countries of all income levels. However, the fact that ethical principles are not spelled out in a specific section of the digital portal and that they have to be deduced and extrapolated limits the perception of how important these are in the context of the UNODC. More information about ethical principles for data processing would be necessary for clarifying the UNODC guidelines. </p>
<h3>OECD (Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development)</h3>
<p>The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development  has a complete section, divided into sub-areas, dedicated to the Ethics Codes and Codes of Conduct. It operates according to the principles of impartiality, legality, integrity and transparency on a daily basis. Those ethical principles, regarding also the data processing are extremely clear within the guidelines. </p>
<h3>World Health Organization (WHO):</h3>
<p>The World Health Organization promotes transparency and management of corporate-level risk, within the framework of WHO’s ethical principles. It promotes the practice of the ethical principles derived from the international civil service standards of conduct for all WHO staff and associated personnel. WHO has a Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct based on integrity, accountability, independence and impartiality, respect and professional commitment. The document is incredibly detailed and fives all the necessary information regarding their policy of action and their ethical principles. </p>
<h3>Ministero della Giustizia:</h3>
<p>The institutional portal exclusively guarantees the fulfillment of the obligations relating to transparency provided for by Legislative Decree no.33 of 14 March 2013. Transparency is intended official, statistical and personal data protection secrets. It relies on the democratic principle and the constitutional principles of equality, impartiality, good performance, responsibility, effectiveness and efficiency in use of public resources, integrity and loyalty in serving the nation. It is a condition of guarantee of individual and collective freedoms, as well as civil, political and social rights, integrates the right to good administration and contributes to the creation of an open administration, at the service of the user.</p>
<h3>Our World in Data</h3>
<p>The ethical perspective of Our World in Data is clearly spelled out on the portal. The impartial, free from cognitive bias and accountable approach is carefully explained.</p>
<h3>Eurostat</h3>
<p>The Statistical Office of the European Union ensure to work in order that users can take advantage of up-to-date, precise and detailed data. The absence of prejudice is specified as long as the freedom from cognitive bias in the processing of data. A detailed document is also provided that gives information on methodological aspects and the related transparency of data processing.</p>
