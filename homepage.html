<h1>What are the living conditions of the prison population in Europe and in Italy? Are their rights as human beings respected?</h1>

<p>The <span class = "jail">JAIL</span> <span class = "od2">|OD|</span> <span class="jail">BREAK</span> project was born from the careful reading of article 27 of the Italian constitution which says: <span class="quote">"the penalties cannot consist in treatments contrary to the sense of humanity and must aim at the re-education of the offender"</span>. Hence, the questions:</p>

<p>What are the real conditions of prisoners? What does the prison population face on a daily basis? Are they guaranteed the right to health? Is the re-educational principle exercised - and if so - in what terms, or is it simply punitive?</p>

<p>We therefore reflected on different areas to develop our analysis: a general overview of the prison population (status, sex, citizenship), physical and mental health conditions, drug use prevention, treatment of young offenders, mortality in prisons and staff available. We tried to understand in which countries the aforementioned conditions were worse and reflect if they were somehow linked to economic and social conditions of those countries.</p>

<p>We chose different datasets related to our scenarios, coming from different sources: The United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Eurostat, World Health Organization (WHO),  EU Commission and EU Open Data Portal, Organisation for Economic Co-operation (OECD).
